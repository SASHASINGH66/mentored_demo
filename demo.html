        <h2>reasons why france sucks</h2>
        <p>
          the people are so arrigant and cocky. they just do not want to work.
          also the french national team (soccer) sucks and i am very happy that
          they lost the world cup. also france is very bad at winning wars.
          weakass bitches.

          the best cos to have and is always super supportive and good in
          stressful situations ... he still is not as good as sasha tho.
